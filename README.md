For this project all I did was code a small code that basiclly tell you what your pace is in 1km per min. 
It also tells you how much money you have left. Its literally a Tokyo Marathon Qualifer. All you have to do is inter your first name and last name,
how many miles can you run in 10 min and how much money you have saved for the marathon. It converts mi/min to km/min.
